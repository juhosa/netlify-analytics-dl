# Netlify Analytics Script

Get data from the undocumented Netlify Analytics API.

## Usage

1. Figure out your `page_id` and your `bearer token`.
2. Copy `.env-example`, rename it to `.env`
3. Insert the `page_id` and `bearer token` to correct places in the `.env`-file.

## Disclaimer

This is in no way a Netlify product or feature. This is just me hacking away.
